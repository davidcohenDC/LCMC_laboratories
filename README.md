# LCMC Laboratory

This repository contains the exercises and solutions for the laboratory part of the "Linguaggi, Compilatori e Modelli Computazionali" (LCMC) course. The focus is on practical support for the theoretical concepts taught in class.

## Course Topics

### Automata and Formal Languages
- Finite State Automata
- Regular Expressions and their relation to Finite Automata
- Context-Free Grammars
- Pushdown Automata and their relation to Context-Free Grammars
- Turing Machines
- Recursive and Recursively Enumerable Languages

### Basic Logic
- Propositional Logic
- Predicate Logic

### Compilers
- Lexical Analyzers
- Syntax Parsers
- Static Program Checks
- Code Generation

### Computational Models
- Transition Systems
- Temporal Logics for system specification and verification
- Finite State Concurrent Processes
- Petri Nets
